# Sand simulation demo

## How to build?

You need to build raylib static library and put `libraylib.a` to `sim/lib`
(`libraylibweb.a` if you wanna compiled to WebAssembly), just follow the
[raylib build instruction](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki) base on your OS.

After that, by simply running `make` should build & put the executable file
to `sim/build`.
